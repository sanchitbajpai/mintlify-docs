# Mintlify Documentation Website Clone

This project is a **desktop-first recreation of the Mintlify documentation website**, built using only **HTML and CSS**, as part of the **Web Dev Cohort 2026** assignment.

The goal was to closely match the **layout, structure, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy** of the original Mintlify website while maintaining clean and readable code.
